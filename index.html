        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            I'm a 28-year-old software engineer, passionate about robotics and computer vision.
            I hold a MSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and
            I currently work at a startup developing software for fully automated drone-based inspections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being in a very small team, I had the opportunity to contribute to several aspects of autonomous mission software,
            including system architecture, mission management, path planning, drone control, and simulation.
            The area that interests me the most, however, is perception: how an autonomous agent extracts
            useful information from images and raw sensor data and how this information is further processed 
            to build an internal, coherent and mostly accurate representation of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this domain, I've worked with both classical computer vision approaches and learning-based methods.
            I enjoy integrating these two paradigms, grounding data-driven models in solid algorithmic and geometric foundations. 
            Looking ahead, I'd really like to deepen my knowledge into deep learning techniques for 3D perception and scene understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in computing started from a hands-on project—building a motorized time-lapse dolly
            because buying one was too expensive—and it's still driven by the desire to build things.
            In my free time, I enjoy combining software and hardware into small mechatronics projects that involve 
            ESP32, sensors, actuators and, more recently, 3D printing.
