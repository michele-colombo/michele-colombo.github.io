Research project carried out for my MSc thesis in Computer Science at Politecnico di Milano. We devised a new method for computing a basis for functions defined on a mesh, with the aim of improving shape matching via Functional Maps. The project was carried out in the context of the Honours Programme in Scientific Research and lead to a publication in mid-tier conference (STAG 2022, Best Paper Award) and journal (Computer and Graphics 2023).
